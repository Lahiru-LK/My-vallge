	<p  style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250);text-align:left;">The Danture campaign comprised a series of encounters between the Portuguese and the
	Kingdom of Kandy in 1594, part of the Sinhalese_Portuguese War. It is considered a turning point
	in the indigenous resistance to Portuguese expansion. For the first time in Sri Lanka a Portuguese 
	army was essentially annihilated, when they were on the verge of the total conquest of the island.
	A 20,000-strong Portuguese army, led by Governor Pedro Lopes de Sousa, invaded Kandy on 5 July 
	1594. After three months, severely depleted by guerilla warfare and mass desertions, what remained of 
	the Portuguese army was annihilated at Danture by the Kandyans under King Vimaladharmasuriya. With this 
	victory, the Kingdom of Kandy emerged as a major military power; it was to retain its independence, against
	Portuguese, Dutch, and British armies, until 1815.
Victory at Danture notwithstanding, only the mobile section of the Portuguese army in Ceylon was annihilated, 
while their strongholds remained intact, and so Kandy was unable to follow up with an advance into the lowlands.
 The Portuguese would in the future renew their offensive against Kandy under the reorganized forces of captain-general	
 Dom Jeronimo de Azevedo, devastating Kandy in the process.</p></div>
