<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">By the time of King Mayadunne's death in 1581, his Sitawaka kingdom 
controlled almost all the Sri Lankan lowlands except for a narrow stretch 
of territory along the west coast, which was ruled by King Dom João Dharmapala 
under the protection of the Portuguese. After Mayadunne's death, his son Tikiri
 Bandara succeeded to the Sitawaka throne as Rajasinha I of 
Sitawaka, also known as Sitawaka Rajasinghe.
Sitawaka Rajasinghe turned his attention to the Kingdom of Kandy, ruled by King
 Karaliyadde Bandara, whose daughter was married to Dom João Dharmapala. In 1582
 Rajasinghe defeated the Kandyan army at Balana, with the assistance of a Kandyan chieftain, 
 Virasundara Mudiyanse of Peradeniya. The Kandyan king, with his queen, son, infant daughter Kusumasana Devi,
 and nephew Yamasinghe Bandara, fled to Trincomalee under the protection of the Portuguese.
